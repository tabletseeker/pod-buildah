A simple shell script that uses buildah to create customized OCI/docker images and podman to deploy rootless containers designed to automate compilation/building of github projects, applications and kernels, including any other conainerized task or service. Pre-defined environment variables, various command options, native integration of all containers with apt-cacher-ng, live log monitoring with neovim and the use of tmux to consolidate container access, ensures maximum flexibility and efficiency during container use.

## Preview
- [x] Sneak Peek
### Example #1
* pod-buildah runs the same command in multiple containers or an individual command in each container separately, while the main container process runs in the background. Each command's output is displayed in a separate tmux session/pane.

  <img src="https://github.com/tabletseeker/pod-buildah/blob/master/help-steps/preview2.gif" width="85%" height="85%">

### Example #2
* pod-buildah deploys 2 rootless debian bookworm containers which build the nyxt browser and linux kernel. Here is a quick overview of the tmux session layout, logging with neovim and separate container shells.

  <img src="https://github.com/tabletseeker/pod-buildah/blob/master/help-steps/preview.gif" width="85%" height="85%">

### Example #3
* pod-buildah automatically creates 4 customized debian bookworm images and based on them deploys 4 rootless containers using podman which build multiple tags of ffmpeg, youtube-dl, linux_kernel and mpv.

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Znw6zQXt/68747470733a2f2f692e706f7374696d672e63632f4a376b74347250432f33302e706e67.png" width="85%" height="85%">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JncJTjt7/31.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Logs are synchronously generated and tailed with neovim in a tmux session. (full screen toggle per pane possible)

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JzjctY0t/6b.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* While the main container process (in this case a build script) is running in the background, pod-buildah runs a custom command in a separate tmux session. By default this command launches a shell `/bin/bash` inside each container to allow direct access. (container label is also the username)

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/KjKWsKhB/Screenshot-2025-10-11-18-04-17.png" width="85%" height="85%">
* However, any command can be automatically executed on startup, like for example monitoring tools.

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gk2hn9mQ/final6.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Every container natively uses apt-cacher-ng (also containerized) which is attached to a third and final tmux session. It caches packages during the image creation, container setup and execution of the container process.

## Installation
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Clone repository
1. Dependencies
   ```
    sudo apt-get install -y podman buildah tmux neovim
   ```
3. Clone repo
   ```sh
   git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabletseeker/pod-buildah
   ```
[ðŸ”¼ Back to Top](#Roadmap)  

## How it works
### Mechanics
- [x] Basic Functionality
* Only two things are required to run pod-buildah containers.
1. Target Name
   - Location: `pod-buildah/help-steps/targets`
   - Determines the name of the image, container, container labels, tmux titles, UID inside container etc.
   - It is possible to add a prefix via option `-x|--prefix`
2. Main Script
   - Location: `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/pod_start`
   - Every container executes a main script on startup called `pod_start`.
   - This script controls the container's behavior while making use of the provided ENV variables and options provided by pod-buildah.
   - If this script does not exist, a customizable template is automatically copied from `pod-buildah/help-steps/script_template`
   - When a custom command is chosen with option `-c|--command`, the main script is not executed and the container process defaults to `/bin/bash`.

[ðŸ”¼ Back to Top](#Roadmap)

### Session Management
- [x] Tmux Shortcuts
* Navigate panes: `Alt + Arrow_Key`
* Toggle Full Screen: `Alt + d`
* Choose Session: `Alt + s`
* Navigate Neovim Tabs: `g t`

- [x] Tmux Sessions
* Three separate tmux sessions, each with 1 window and unique identifiers are launched by pod-buildah.
    - apt-cacher: tails the apt-cacher container's /var/log/apt-cacher-ng
    - pod-buildah: launches a shell `/bin/bash` inside every running container
    - pod-log: tails each of the specified logs (default 3) with neovim
    - `Alt + s` opens the choose-session display
    
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sgvcdJM3/1b-final.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Each started container automatically produces new panes in each window.
    - pod-buildah: 1 new pane
    - pod-log: 3 new panes
    
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7ZfV8N54/1a-final.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* A pod-buildah pane (if no custom command is used) allows the user to simultaneously interact with the container inside a shell while the main
  container process is running in the background.
    - The container's label also poses as the username.
    
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZnRTNDrF/5.png" width="85%" height="85%">
  
* Each pod-buildah pane is coupled with 3 pod-log panes in a separate pod-log session which display the logs as the container process is running.
    - If only one or the native branch is chosen, the default logs and pane titles are used.
    - The default log titles are `install.log`,`git.log` and `build.log`
    - The tmux log title is composed of the target name and the log name.
    - Custom log names can be chosen with option `-ln|l--log-names`. 
    
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fyLwdgx0/1.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* If multiple containers are launched, each window is automatically split.
    - pod-buildah window layout: tiled
    - pod-log window layout: 3 x 3
    
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vTBQnSW-3/6.png" width="85%" height="85%">
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nrzHmwvk/2.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* A total of 4 pod-buildah and 9 pod-log panes are allowed per window.
    - After that limit has been reached a new window is created in each session.
    - You can navigate between panes via `Alt + Arrow_Key`
    - `Alt + d` toggles fullscreen per pane

### Command Exit
- [x] Exit Status

* Once a custom command that is executed inside a container with option `-c|--command` exits or the container itself stops because execution of its main process has finished, the exit status will be indicated graphically by a colored text box in the target container's tmux pane. Since pod-buildah always runs a custom command for each target via tmux, by default `/bin/bash`, this exit message will always appear in any given pod-buildah tmux pane. When it is visible, a custom post command can be run inside that same tmux pane by pressing `Enter`. This post command can be controlled with option `-tc|--tmux-command`. By default, it launches neovim.

    See [ðŸ”¼ Parameter Description](#Options-In-Depth)

* Exit Code 0 is marked with a green, blinking bar.
  * Running `exit 0` in container linux_kernel

    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/3rGTpBf9/8a.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Exit Code 1 is marked with a red, static bar.
  * Running`exit 1` in container linux_kernel

    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZKhhLdXs/8b.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Any other exit code is marked with a grey, blinking bar. When a container's main process exits and the container stops, it will inherently exit all `podman exec` (tmux) commands attached to it with non-zero exit codes, such as`Code 137`.
  * Container linux_kernel stops because main process finished

    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPHSjnw6/42.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* The same applies to multiple, chained commands.
  * Running a command chain inside container linux_kernel that exits 0
    ```sh
    ./pod-buildah -t linux_kernel -c "sudo apt update && cat /etc/*-release"
    ```
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BZF0Dg7K/7a.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* If any part of the chain exits 1, the red bar will appear.
  * Running a command chain inside container linux_kernel that exits 1
    ```sh
    ./pod-buildah -t linux_kernel -c "sudo apt update && cat /etc/*-release && exit 1"
    ```
    <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4WWQkSQ/7b.png" width="85%" height="85%">

* Non-zero or one exit codes again result in a grey bar being displayed.
  * Running a command chain inside container linux_kernel with ambiguous exit
    ```sh
    ./pod-buildah -t linux_kernel -c "sudo apt update && cat /etc/*-release && ls foo"
    ```

### Build Folders
- [x] Build-Data

* The directory `pod-buildah/build-data` contains your project folders from which each individual container can read 4 files, `url`, `branch`, `packages` and `pod_start`.
    |  Name                                             | Description              | Location
    | --------------------------------------------------| -------------------------|------------|
    | url |Any github repository url which the container can clone and update from | host: pod-buildah/build-data/url
    | branch | Any github repository branch | host: host: pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/branch
    | packages| Build dependencies to be installed inside the container  | host: pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/packages
    | pod_start | A custom script that will launch the container process  | host: pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/pod_start
    | scripts | A folder for additional helper scripts to be called by pod_start  | host: pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/scripts

* `url`, `branch` and `packages` do not necessarily have to be populated and can also be supplied via options `-u|--url`, `-b|--branch` and `-p|--packages`. If they are left empty, the corresponding env variables `$PACKAGES` and `$URL` and `$BRANCH` will be empty in the container.
* During the container's image creation, the included main script `pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/pod_start` (and all scripts located in `pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/scripts`) is placed in the container image's `/usr/bin` and executed by default when the container starts.

[ðŸ”¼ Back to Top](#Roadmap)
## Getting Started
- [x] First Steps
* Example folders `nyxt` and `linux_kernel` with working main scripts have been added to `pod-buildah/build-data`, serving as templates for build containers.
1. Add a target name to `pod-buildah/help-steps/targets`.
2. Create a folder with that target name in build-data `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>`.
3. Create the main script `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/pod_start`.
4. (Optional) Create the folder `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/scripts` for additional helper scripts.
   - All scripts located in `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/scripts` are copied to the docker image's `/usr/bin/`
   - You may add additional helper scripts which can be called by pod_start from `/usr/bin`.
5. (Optional) Add a url, branch and packages file to `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>`, which will be used as defaults.
   - Another way of supplying these values is via options `-b|--branch`, `-u|--url`, `-p|packages`.
7. Execute `pod-buildah` with your desired options.

[ðŸ”¼ Back to Top](#Roadmap)

### Options In-Depth
- [x] Parameter Description
1. `-t`, `--target` accepts target names specified in `pod-buildah/help-steps/targets`. Multiple target inputs are separated by `,` which will be started in sequence, having all further options apply to each container equally. For example, `-t <target1>,<target2>`

2. `-r`, `--rebuild` removes and rebuilds a specific or all given image names. It accepts either `main` or `cache`, but both inputs are also possible. For example, `-r cache,main`, `-r main` or `-r cache`.        
    * `main` is the container image, derived from the source_image, which can be changed with option `-si|--source-image` (Default is debian:bookworm-slim).`pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/pod_start` and all scripts located in `pod-buildah/build-data/<target_name>/scripts are copied to its `/usr/bin` directory. If changes have been made to any of these scripts outside of a running container, the main image needs to be rebuilt in order to reflect those changes.
        
    * `cache` is the apt-cacher container image. `acng.conf` can be modified in `pod-buildah/apt-cacher/acng.conf`

3.  `-p`, `--packages` allows overriding the default packages to be installed in a container which are specified in `pod-buildah/build-data/<target>/packages`. This argument needs to be passed with quotes `""`
    * Example: `--packages "build-essential cmake libssl-dev"`
    * Example: `-p "$(xargs <./my_package_list)"`
4. `-s`, `--signal` sends a signal to an existing container.
    * `restart` - restarts the container if it exists (only acts as stop with run option `--rm`)
    * `stop` - stops the container if it is running
    * `kill`- kills the container if it is running
    * `rm` - removes the container if it exists
    * `"rm --force"` kills and removes the container if it exists
5. `-pc`, `--post-command` specifies a custom command executed inside the container after the container process exits.
     * This option grants the ability to add a custom command executed after the container's main process exits. Any command is valid, but the most sensible use of this option would be to keep a container from stopping after its main process exits by for example passing `-pc /bin/bash`. This would result in both the container itself and it's corresponding pod-buildah tmux session to remain open indefinitely, even after the main process has been completed.
6. `-x`, `--prefix` allows for the use of a custom prefix
    * The container labels, image label, tmux title and user inside the container are named by the target_name.
    * This option allows for an additional identifier to be added to that name, changing the target_name to`<prefix><target_name>`
7. `-sv`, `--source-volume` determines the mount location of the source volume
    * The source volume contains `logs`, `artifacts` and `clone` directories which are used inside the container.
8. `-si`, `--source-image` determines the base image tag aka the operating system.
    * `docker.io/debian:bookworm-slim` is used by default, but any version of Debian or its derivatives can be used.
9. `-bl`, `--branch-log` allows separate log files to be generated for the first log type (default: install.log). When multiple branches are selected with option `-b|--branch`, pod-buildah will create separate log folders for each branch. By default the `install.log` or first of the three log types, is never created individually across separate branch folders. This is because the installing of packages would yield the same output across all separate install logs, which makes individual logging unecessary. Option `-bl|--branch-log` stops this, by creating the first log (install.log) separately among all branch folders. This makes sense if the user needs separate outputs of this log for each branch, which would require minor adjustments in `pod_start`.
10. `-tc`, `--tmux-command` executes a custom command inside a pod-buildah tmux session after the container process exits.
    * Whenever a container exits its corresponding pod-buildah tmux pane will display a graphical representation of the exit code (red or green) with the option to launch a custom command by pressing `Enter` or to exit completely via `Crl + c`. By defaut, this custom command, if executed, opens all files located in the current target buid-data folder with neovim to allow for modifications after a container run. This option grants the ability to change that command.

### Command Examples
- [x] Command Structure
1. Single container targets can be run one by one in order to specifiy arguments individually.
  ```sh
  ./pod-buildah -t <target_name> -p "libgcc-s1 librhash1 libstdc++6 zlib1g" -x "test1" -bl
  ```
2. Or multiple targets can be run in sequence, meaning the specified arguments will apply to all given target containers equally.
  ```sh
  ./pod-buildah -t <target_name1>,<target_name2>,<target_name3> -p "libgcc-s1 librhash1 libstdc++6 zlib1g" -x "test1" -bl
  ```
3. When running singular instances of pod-buildah in a command , make sure to use option `-d|--detach` so that the tmux session isn't attached until the final container is started.
  ```sh
  ./pod-buildah -t <target_name> -d; ./pod-buildah -t <target_name2> -d; ./pod-buildah -t <target_name>3
  ```
- [x] Sample Commands
* Builds the Nyxt Browser with default branch, url and packages.
   ```sh
  ./pod-buildah -t nyxt
  ```
* Builds the Nyxt Browser with different packages than the default.
    - The default packages in `pod-buildah/build-data/nyxt/packages` are overwritten by option `-p|--packages`
  ```sh
  ./pod-buildah -t nyxt -p "build-essential cmake ninja-build cmake-format"
  ```
* Builds the Linux Kernel branch 6.15
    - The current default branch is 6.15 in `pod-buildah/build-data/linux_kernel/branch`

### Mount Directories
- [x] Volume Mounts

By default two folders are generated upon starting a container, if not otherwise defined.

|  Name                                             | Description              | Default Location
| --------------------------------------------------| -------------------------|------------|
| source | Mounts the build container's working directory | host: pod-buildah/source
| cache | Mounts the cache container's /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng directory | host: pod-buildah/apt-cacher/cache

   * The source directory contains 3 sub-directories
     - `clone` - contains the cloned source code
     - `artifacts` - meant to contain built binaries, libraries etc. after a successful build
     - `logs` - contains the log files
   * Options `--source-volume` and `--cacher-volume` can be used to set custom locations.
   * If the apt-cacher container is running, the apt-cacher volume remains the same until it is stopped.
   * All build containers automatically connect to the apt-cacher container via `host.containers.internal`. In case of a large amount of simultaneous clients, additional apt-cacher containers will be deployed to cover the overhead.

### Container Defaults
- [x] Default Behavior
#### Container State
1. By default, the script's `podman run` command launches containers with the `--rm` flag. This means that once a container exits all data that was not preserved in a mount is lost. It also means that a container can never exist without simultaneously running. By default only one instance of a container based on an image can exist at any given time. pod-buildah can distinguish between a running and existing container, allowing for the `--rm` flag to be removed if so desired.

2. When a running container's target is launched again with pod-buildah, the call is simply ignored in order to preserve data and the ongoing container process. Tmux panes corresponding with this container target however are respawned, to allow quick and easy restarting of dead panes without container interference. If option `-c|--command` was used, the pod-buildah pane running this command will be respawned with the newly passed command directive, which is either custom or default (/bin/bash). The same goes for options `-tc|--tmux-command`. Option `-pc|--post-command` is ignored however, because the current container process is still running.

3. Containers can run `/bin/bash` as a default post-command after the main process exits in order to prevent the container from stopping and allowing for potential troubleshooting or general access through a pod-buildah tmux pane. In order to enable this behavior uncomment `#CT_POST_ARG="/bin/bash"` in `pod-buildah/help-steps/variables`

4. Containers exit after execution of the main process has been completed. When this happens, any command attached in the tmux session pod-buildah, be it custom or the default `/bin/bash`, will also exit. This behavior can be changed with option `-pc|--post-command`. In order to keep the container running after the main process one could for example pass `-pc /bin/bash`. This would result in both the container itself and it's corresponding pod-buildah tmux session to remain open indefinitely.

#### Auto-Generated Files
3. All log files, source and build folders are automatically generated. Technically, a target_name is all that's needed to run pod-buildah and start any given container.
If no main script `pod_start` has been provided, a `script_template` will be copied in its place. By default, this template does not execute anything, but it can be changed to perform a default task.

#### Logging Convention
4. The default log file names are `install.log`, `git.log` and `build.log`. Option `-ln|--log-name` automatically overwrites these values.
If less than three names are given, the default remainder still applies. For example, `-ln "prep.log,download.log"` would yield the following log names, `prep.log`, `download.log`, `build.log`. And `-ln "prep.log"` results in `prep.log`, `git.log`, `build.log`.

5. When multiple branches are selected with option `-b|--branch`, pod-buildah will create separate log folders for each branch. By default the `install.log` or first of the three log types, is never created individually across separate branch folders. This is because the installing of packages would yield the same output across all separate install logs, which makes individual logging unecessary. Option `-bl|--branch-log` stops this, by creating the first log (install.log) separately among all branch folders. This makes sense if the user needs separate outputs of this log for each branch, which would require minor adjustments in `pod_start`.

#### Neovim
6. `pod-buildah/hel-steps/vimrc` can be configured to change neovim's behavior as needed. By default it contains functions for tailing, renaming tab titles and color scheme adjustments.

#### Container Environment
- [x] Environment Variables

The container will provide environment variables, which can be used by the build script, carrying the values given via certain options such as for example `--build-packages`, `--git-url` etc. and more.

|  Variable     | Description              | Default Value
| ------------| -------------------------|------------|
| CLEAN      | Set by option `-w|--wipe`  | null
| SOURCE_DIR | Mother directory inside the container| /home/<target_name> 
| CLONE_DIR |  Clone directory inside the container | /home/<target_name>/clone
| ARTIFACT_DIR | Artifact directory inside the container | /home/<target_name>/artifacts
| LOG_DIR  	| Log directory inside the container | /home/<target_name>/logs
| TARGET | Current target name | <target_name>
| URL   | Url indicated in target build-data or via option | null
| BRANCH 		| Branch indicated in target build-data or via option | null
| PACKAGES  	| Packages indicated in target build-data or via option | null
| LOG_POSTFIX  	| Default log names or supplied via option | null
| TIMEFORMAT  | ENV variable used by time for custom formats of elapsed time | custom

#### Using Services for Automation
- [x] Systemd Integration

* You can use the provided `.service` file to automate the execution of any container/cluster with specific arguments and within a given time frame. This is probably the most convenient way to deploy build containers under certain conditions, for example when a new github release is available.

#### Caching
- [x] Apt-Cacher-Ng

* The apt-cacher container publishes port `3142:3142/tcp` which all build containers automatically point towards via `host.containers.internal` and apt.conf option `Acquire::http::Proxy`.
* `acng.conf` is available under `pod-buildah/apt-cacher/acng.conf` for further customization
* Health checks are performed in 15s intervals. `podman ps` will indicate a healthy (working) or unhealthy (dead) status.
* Once the maximum number of connections has been reached, the apt-cacher container will automatically launch an additional instance. This process will continue up to a maximum of 5 simultaneously running apt-cacher containers.
